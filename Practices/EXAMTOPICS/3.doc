### Q1
To run an application, a DevOps Engineer launches an Amazon EC2 instances with public IP addresses in a public subnet. A user data script obtains the application artifacts and installs them on the instances upon launch. A change to the security classification of the application now requires the instances to run with no access to the Internet. While the instances launch successfully and show as healthy, the application does not seem to be installed.
Which of the following should successfully install the application while complying with the new rule?
A. Launch the instances in a public subnet with Elastic IP addresses attached. Once the application is installed and running, run a script to disassociate the Elastic IP addresses afterwards.
B. Set up a NAT gateway. Deploy the EC2 instances to a private subnet. Update the private subnet's route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.
C. Publish the application artifacts to an Amazon S3 bucket and create a VPC endpoint for S3. Assign an IAM instance profile to the EC2 instances so they can read the application artifacts from the S3 bucket.
D. Create a security group for the application instances and whitelist only outbound traffic to the artifact repository. Remove the security group rule once the install is complete.

### Q10
A company has a hybrid architecture solution in which some legacy systems remain on-premises, while a specific cluster of servers is moved to AWS. The company cannot reconfigure the legacy systems, so the cluster nodes must have a fixed hostname and local IP address for each server that is part of the cluster.
The DevOps Engineer must automate the configuration for a six-node cluster with high availability across three Availability Zones (AZs), placing two elastic network interfaces in a specific subnet for each AZ. Each node's hostname and local IP address should remain the same between reboots or instance failures.
Which solution involves the LEAST amount of effort to automate this task?
A. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application and a specific environment for each server of the cluster. For each environment, give the hostname, elastic network interface, and AZ as input parameters. Use the local health agent to name the instance and attach a specific elastic network interface based on the current environment.
B. Create a reusable AWS CloudFormation template to manage an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of 1 and a maximum size of 1. Give the hostname, elastic network interface, and AZ as stack parameters. Use those parameters to set up an EC2 instance with EC2 Auto Scaling and a user data script to attach to the specific elastic network interface. Use CloudFormation nested stacks to nest the template six times for a total of six nodes needed for the cluster, and deploy using the master template.
C. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table with the list of hostnames subnets, and elastic network interfaces to be used. Create a single AWS CloudFormation template to manage an Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of 6 and a maximum size of 6. Create a programmatic solution that is installed in each instance that will lock/release the assignment of each hostname and local IP address, depending on the subnet in which a new instance will be launched.
D. Create a reusable AWS CLI script to launch each instance individually, which will name the instance, place it in a specific AZ, and attach a specific elastic network interface. Monitor the instances and in the event of failure, replace the missing instance manually by running the script again.

### Q18
A Development team is building more than 40 applications. Each app is a three-tiered web application based on an ELB Application Load Balancer, Amazon EC2, and Amazon RDS. Because the applications will be used internally, the Security team wants to allow access to the 40 applications only from the corporate network and block access from external IP addresses. The corporate network reaches the internet through proxy servers. The proxy servers have 12 proxy IP addresses that are being changed one or two times per month. The Network Infrastructure team manages the proxy servers; they upload the file that contains the latest proxy
IP addresses into an Amazon S3 bucket. The DevOps Engineer must build a solution to ensure that the applications are accessible from the corporate network.
Which solution achieves these requirements with MINIMAL impact to application development, MINIMAL operational effort, and the LOWEST infrastructure cost?
A. Implement an AWS Lambda function to read the list of proxy IP addresses from the S3 object and to update the ELB security groups to allow HTTPS only from the given IP addresses. Configure the S3 bucket to invoke the Lambda function when the object is updated. Save the IP address list to the S3 bucket when they are changed.
B. Ensure that all the applications are hosted in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Otherwise, consolidate the applications into a single VPC. Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection with an active/standby configuration. Change the ELB security groups to allow only inbound HTTPS connections from the corporate network IP addresses.
C. Implement a Python script with the AWS SDK for Python (Boto), which downloads the S3 object that contains the proxy IP addresses, scans the ELB security groups, and updates them to allow only HTTPS inbound from the given IP addresses. Launch an EC2 instance and store the script in the instance. Use a cron job to execute the script daily.
D. Enable ELB security groups to allow HTTPS inbound access from the Internet. Use Amazon Cognito to integrate the company's Active Directory as the identity provider. Change the 40 applications to integrate with Amazon Cognito so that only company employees can log into the application.

### Q54
A DevOps Engineer is designing a deployment strategy for a web application. The application will use an Auto Scaling group to launch Amazon EC2 instances using an AMI. The same infrastructure will be deployed in multiple environments (development, test, and quality assurance). The deployment strategy should meet the following requirements: â€¢ Minimize the startup time for the instance â€¢ Allow the same AMI to work in multiple environments â€¢ Store secrets for multiple environments securely
How should this be accomplished?
A. Preconfigure the AMI using an AWS Lambda function that launches an Amazon EC2 instance, and then runs a script to install the software and create the AMI. Configure an Auto Scaling lifecycle hook to determine which environment the instance is launched in, and, based on that finding, run a configuration script. Save the secrets on an .ini file and store them in Amazon S3. Retrieve the secrets using a configuration script in EC2 user data.
B. Preconfigure the AMI by installing all the software using AWS Systems Manager automation and configure Auto Scaling to tag the instances at launch with their specific environment. Then use a bootstrap script in user data to read the tags and configure settings for the environment. Use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store the secrets using AWS KMS.
C. Use a standard AMI from the AWS Marketplace. Configure Auto Scaling to detect the current environment. Install the software using a script in Amazon EC2 user data. Use AWS Secrets Manager to store the credentials for all environments.
D. Preconfigure the AMI by installing all the software and configuration for all environments. Configure Auto Scaling to tag the instances at launch with their environment. Use the Amazon EC2 user data to trigger an AWS Lambda function that reads the instance ID and then reconfigures the setting for the proper environment. Use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store the secrets using AWS KMS.

### Q61
A company wants to implement a CI/CD pipeline for an application that is deployed on AWS. The company also has a source-code analysis tool hosted on premises that checks for security flaws. The tool has not yet been migrated to AWS and can be accessed only on premises. The company wants to run checks against the source code as part of the pipeline before the code is compiled. The checks take anywhere from minutes to an hour to complete.
How can a DevOps Engineer meet these requirements?
A. Use AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline. Add an action to the pipeline to invoke an AWS Lambda function after the source stage. Have the Lambda function invoke the source-code analysis tool on premises against the source input from CodePipeline. The function then waits for the execution to complete and places the output in a specified Amazon S3 location.
B. Use AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline, then create a custom action type. Create a job worker for the custom action that runs on hardware hosted on premises. The job worker handles running security checks with the on-premises code analysis tool and then returns the job results to CodePipeline. Have the pipeline invoke the custom action after the source stage.
C. Use AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline. Add a step after the source stage to make an HTTPS request to the on-premises hosted web service that invokes a test with the source code analysis tool. When the analysis is complete, the web service sends the results back by putting the results in an Amazon S3 output location provided by CodePipeline.
D. Use AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline. Create a shell script that copies the input source code to a location on premises. Invoke the source code analysis tool and return the results to CodePipeline. Invoke the shell script by adding a custom script action after the source stage.

### Q62
A company is adopting AWS CodeDeploy to automate its application deployments for a Java-Apache Tomcat application with an Apache webserver. The
Development team started with a proof of concept, created a deployment group for a developer environment, and performed functional tests within the application.
After completion, the team will create additional deployment groups for staging and production
The current log level is configured within the Apache settings, but the team wants to change this configuration dynamically when the deployment occurs, so that they can set different log level configurations depending on the deployment group without having a different application revision for each group.
How can these requirements be met with the LEAST management overhead and without requiring different script versions for each deployment group?
A. Tag the Amazon EC2 instances depending on the deployment group. Then place a script into the application revision that calls the metadata service and the EC2 API to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to configure the log level settings. Reference the script as part of the Afterinstall lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.
B. Create a script that uses the CodeDeploy environment variable DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_NAME to identify which deployment group the instances is part of. Use this information to configure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the BeforeInstall lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file
C. Create a CodeDeploy custom environment variable for each environment. Then place a script into the application revision that checks this environment variable to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to configure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the ValidateService lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.
D. Create a script that uses the CodeDeploy environment variable DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ID to identify which deployment group the instance is part of to configure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the Install lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.

B. Create an EC2 instance and enable instance recovery. Create an Aurora database with a read replica in a second AZ, and promote it to a primary database instance if the primary database instance fails.
C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to trigger an AWS Lambda function to start a new EC2 instance in an available AZ when the instance status reaches a failure state. Create an Aurora database with a read replica in a second AZ, and promote it to a primary database instance when the primary database instance fails.
D. Assign an Elastic IP address on the instance. Create a second EC2 instance in a second AZ. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to trigger an AWS Lambda function to move the Elastic IP address to the second instance when the first instance fails. Use a single-node Aurora instance.
### Answer
A (Aurora automatically replicate on at least 3 AZs, so single node is enough. ASG with 1 size can make sure that always 1 instance available. As the license is limit, so you can not have two applications running at the same time with the license, need to reinstall the application with the license if have second instance. But for ASG, you can use AMI with the license and only provision one at a time.)

### Q74
An Application team has three environments for their application: development, pre-production, and production. The team recently adopted AWS CodePipeline.
However, the team has had several deployments of misconfigured or nonfunctional development code into the production environment, resulting in user disruption and downtime. The DevOps Engineer must review the pipeline and add steps to identify problems with the application before it is deployed.
What should the Engineer do to identify functional issues during the deployment process? (Choose two.)
A. Use Amazon Inspector to add a test action to the pipeline. Use the Amazon Inspector Runtime Behavior Analysis Inspector rules package to check that the deployed code complies with company security standards before deploying it to production.
B. Using AWS CodeBuild to add a test action to the pipeline to replicate common user activities and ensure that the results are as expected before progressing to production deployment.
C. Create an AWS CodeDeploy action in the pipeline with a deployment configuration that automatically deploys the application code to a limited number of instances. The action then pauses the deployment so that the QA team can review the application functionality. When the review is complete, CodeDeploy resumes and deploys the application to the remaining production Amazon EC2 instances.
D. After the deployment process is complete, run a testing activity on an Amazon EC2 instance in a different region that accesses the application to simulate user behavior. If unexpected results occur, the testing activity sends a warning to an Amazon SNS topic. Subscribe to the topic to get updates.
E. Add an AWS CodeDeploy action in the pipeline to deploy the latest version of the development code to pre-production. Add a manual approval action in the pipeline so that the QA team can test and confirm the expected functionality. After the manual approval action, add a second CodeDeploy action that deploys the approved code to the production environment.

### Q76
A company has a single Developer writing code for an automated deployment pipeline. The Developer is storing source code in an Amazon S3 bucket for each project. The company wants to add more Developers to the team but is concerned about code conflicts and lost work. The company also wants to build a test environment to deploy newer versions of code for testing and allow Developers to automatically deploy to both environments when code is changed in the repository.
What is the MOST efficient way to meet these requirements?
A. Create an AWS CodeCommit repository for each project, use the master branch for production code, and create a testing branch for code deployed to testing. Use feature branches to develop new features and pull requests to merge code to testing and master branches.
B. Create another S3 bucket for each project for testing code, and use an AWS Lambda function to promote code changes between testing and production buckets. Enable versioning on all buckets to prevent code conflicts.
C. Create an AWS CodeCommit repository for each project, and use the master branch for production and test code with different deployment pipelines for each environment. Use feature branches to develop new features.
D. Enable versioning and branching on each S3 bucket, use the master branch for production code, and create a testing branch for code deployed to testing. Have Developers use each branch for developing in each environment.
### Answer
A

### Q77
After presenting a working proof of concept for a new application that uses AWS API Gateway, a Developer must set up a team development environment for the project. Due to a tight timeline, the Developer wants to minimize time spent on infrastructure setup, and would like to reuse the code repository created for the proof of concept. Currently, all source code is stored in AWS CodeCommit.
Company policy mandates having alpha, beta, and production stages with separate Jenkins servers to build code and run tests for every stage. The Development
Manager must have the ability to block code propagation between admins at any time. The Security team wants to make sure that users will not be able to modify the environment without permission.
How can this be accomplished?
A. Create API Gateway alpha, beta, and production stages. Create a CodeCommit trigger to deploy code to the different stages using an AWS Lambda function.
B. Create API Gateway alpha, beta, and production stages. Create an AWS CodePipeline that pulls code from the CodeCommit repository. Create CodePipeline actions to deploy code to the API Gateway stages.
C. Create Jenkins servers for the alpha, beta, and production stages on Amazon EC2 instances. Create multiple CodeCommit triggers to deploy code to different stages using an AWS Lambda function.
D. Create an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that pulls code from the CodeCommit repository. Create alpha, beta, and production stages with Jenkins servers on CodePipeline.
### Answer
D (Pipeline would give the option to stop it with approvals, which C is only based on CodeCommit Triggers)

### Q78
An online company uses Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling extensively to provide an excellent customer experience while minimizing the number of running EC2 instances. The companyâ€™s self-hosted Puppet environment in the application layer manages the configuration of the instances. The IT manager wants the lowest licensing costs and wants to ensure that whenever the EC2 Auto Scaling group scales down, removed EC2 instances are deregistered from the Puppet master as soon as possible.
How can the requirement be met?
A. At instance launch time, use EC2 user data to deploy the AWS CodeDeploy agent. Use CodeDeploy to install the Puppet agent. When the Auto Scaling group scales out, run a script to register the newly deployed instances to the Puppet master. When the Auto Scaling group scales in, use the EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hook to trigger de-registration from the Puppet master. EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING
B. Bake the AWS CodeDeploy agent into the base AMI. When the Auto Scaling group scales out, use CodeDeploy to install the Puppet agent, and execute a script to register the newly deployed instances to the Puppet master. When the Auto Scaling group scales in, use the CodeDeploy ApplicationStop lifecycle hook to run a script to de-register the instance from the Puppet master.
C. At instance launch time, use EC2 user data to deploy the AWS CodeDeploy agent. When the Auto Scaling group scales out, use CodeDeploy to install the Puppet agent, and run a script to register the newly deployed instances to the Puppet master. When the Auto Scaling group scales in, use the EC2 user data instance stop script to run a script to de-register the instance from the Puppet master.
D. Bake the AWS Systems Manager agent into the base AMI. When the Auto Scaling group scales out, use the AWS Systems Manager to install the Puppet agent, and run a script to register the newly deployed instances to the Puppet master. When the Auto Scaling group scales in, use the Systems Manager instance stop lifecycle hook to run a script to de-register the instance from the Puppet master.
### Answer
A (lifecycle hook is better when de-register)

### Q79
A company discovers that some IAM users have been storing their AWS access keys in configuration files that have been pushed to a Git repository hosting service.
Which solution will require the LEAST amount of management overhead while preventing the exposed AWS access keys from being used?
A. Build an application that will create a list of all AWS access keys in the account and search each key on Git repository hosting services. If a match is found, configure the application to disable the associated access key. Then deploy the application to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk worker environment and define a periodic task to invoke the application every hour.
B. Use Amazon Inspector to detect when a key has been exposed online. Have Amazon Inspector send a notification to an Amazon SNS topic when a key has been exposed. Create an AWS Lambda function subscribed to the SNS topic to disable the IAM user to whom the key belongs, and then delete the key so that it cannot be used.
C. Configure AWS Trusted Advisor and create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that uses Trusted Advisor as the event source. Configure the CloudWatch Events rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function as the target. If the Lambda function finds the exposed access keys, then have it disable the access key so that it cannot be used.
D. Create an AWS Config rule to detect when a key is exposed online. Haw AWS Config send change notifications to an SNS topic. Configure an AWS Lambda function that is subscribed to the SNS topic to check the notification sent by AWS Config, and then disable the access key so it cannot be used.

C (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/cloudwatch-events-ta.html)

### Q80
Company policies require that information about IP traffic going between instances in the production Amazon VPC is captured. The capturing mechanism must always be enabled and the Security team must be notified when any changes in configuration occur.
What should be done to ensure that these requirements are met?
A. Using the UserData section of an AWS CloudFormation template, install tcpdump on every provisioned Amazon EC2 instance. The output of the tool is sent to Amazon EFS for aggregation and querying. In addition, scheduling an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule calls an AWS Lambda function to check whether tcpdump is up and running and sends an email to the security organization when there is an exception.
B. Create a flow log for the production VPC and assign an Amazon S3 bucket as a destination for delivery. Using Amazon S3 Event Notification, set up an AWS Lambda function that is triggered when a new log file gets delivered. This Lambda function updates an entry in Amazon DynamoDB, which is periodically checked by scheduling an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to notify security when logs have not arrived.
C. Create a flow log for the production VPC. Create a new rule using AWS Config that is triggered by configuration changes of resources of type â€˜EC2:VPCâ€™. As part of configuring the rule, create an AWS Lambda function that looks up flow logs for a given VPC. If the VPC flow logs are not configured, return a â€˜NON_COMPLIANTâ€™ status and notify the security organization.
D. Configure a new trail using AWS CloudTrail service. Using the UserData section of an AWS CloudFormation template, install tcpdump on every provisioned Amazon EC2 instance. Connect Amazon Athena to the CloudTrail and write an AWS Lambda function that monitors for a flow log disable event. Once the CloudTrail entry has been spotted, alert the security organization.

### Q84
A healthcare company has a critical application running in AWS. Recently, the company experienced some down time. if it happens again, the company needs to be able to recover its application in another AWS Region. The application uses Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 instances. The company also maintains a custom AMI that contains its application. This AMI is changed frequently.
The workload is required to run in the primary region, unless there is a regional service disruption, in which case traffic should fail over to the new region.
Additionally, the cost for the second region needs to be low. The RTO is 2 hours.
Which solution allows the company to fail over to another region in the event of a failure, and also meet the above requirements?
A. Maintain a copy of the AMI from the main region in the backup region. Create an Auto Scaling group with one instance using a launch configuration that contains the copied AMI. Use an Amazon Route 53 record to direct traffic to the load balancer in the backup region in the event of failure, as required. Allow the Auto Scaling group to scale out as needed during a failure.
B. Automate the copying of the AMI in the main region to the backup region. Generate an AWS Lambda function that will create an EC2 instance from the AMI and place it behind a load balancer. Using the same Lambda function, point the Amazon Route 53 record to the load balancer in the backup region. Trigger the Lambda function in the event of a failure.
C. Place the AMI in a replicated Amazon S3 bucket. Generate an AWS Lambda function that can create a launch configuration and assign it to an already created Auto Scaling group. Have one instance in this Auto Scaling group ready to accept traffic. Trigger the Lambda function in the event of a failure. Use an Amazon Route 53 record and modify it with the same Lambda function to point to the load balancer in the backup region.
D. Automate the copying of the AMI to the backup region. Create an AWS Lambda function that can create a launch configuration and assign it to an already created Auto Scaling group. Set the Auto Scaling group maximum size to 0 and only increase it with the Lambda function during a failure. Trigger the Lambda function in the event of a failure. Use an Amazon Route 53 record and modify it with the same Lambda function to point to the load balancer in the backup region.

### Q86
A company runs a database on a single Amazon EC2 instance in a development environment. The data is stored on separate Amazon EBS volumes that are attached to the EC2 instance. An Amazon Route 53 A record has been created and configured to point to the EC2 instance. The company would like to automate the recovery of the database instance when an instance or Availability Zone (AZ) fails. The company also wants to keep its costs low. The RTO is 4 hours and
RPO is 12 hours.
Which solution should a DevOps Engineer implement to meet these requirements?
A. Run the database in an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum instance count of 1 in multiple AZs. Add a lifecycle hook to the Auto Scaling group and define an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that is triggered when a lifecycle event occurs. Have the CloudWatch Events rule invoke an AWS Lambda function to detach or attach the Amazon EBS data volumes from the EC2 instance based on the event. Configure the EC2 instance UserData to mount the data volumes (retry on failure with a short delay), then start the database and update the Route 53 record.
B. Run the database on two separate EC2 instances in different AZs with one active and the other as a standby. Attach the data volumes to the active instance. Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function on EC2 instance termination. The Lambda function launches a replacement EC2 instance. If the terminated instance was the active node, then the function attaches the data volumes to the standby node. Start the database and update the Route 53 record.
C. Run the database in an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum instance count of 1 in multiple AZs. Create an AWS Lambda function that is triggered by a scheduled Amazon CloudWatch Events rule every 4 hours to take a snapshot of the data volume and apply a tag. Have the instance UserData get the latest snapshot, create a new volume from it, and attach and mount the volume. Then start the database and update the Route 53 record.
D. Run the database on two separate EC2 instances in different AZs. Configure one of the instances as a master and the other as a standby. Set up replication between the master and standby instances. Point the Route 53 record to the master. Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function upon the EC2 instance termination. The Lambda function launches a replacement EC2 instance. If the terminated instance was the active node, the function promotes the standby to master and points the Route 53 record to it.

### Q87
A consulting company was hired to assess security vulnerabilities within a client companyâ€™s application and propose a plan to remediate all identified issues. The architecture is identified as follows: Amazon S3 storage for content, an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer with attached Amazon EBS storage, and an Amazon RDS MySQL database. There are also several AWS Lambda functions that communicate directly with the RDS database using connection string statements in the code.
The consultants identified the top security threat as follows: the application is not meeting its requirement to have encryption at rest.
What solution will address this issue with the LEAST operational overhead and will provide monitoring for potential future violations?
A. Enable SSE encryption on the S3 buckets and RDS database. Enable OS-based encryption of data on EBS volumes. Configure Amazon Inspector agents on EC2 instances to report on insecure encryption ciphers. Set up AWS Config rules to periodically check for non-encrypted S3 objects.
B. Configure the application to encrypt each file prior to storing on Amazon S3. Enable OS-based encryption of data on EBS volumes. Encrypt data on write to RDS. Run cron jobs on each instance to check for encrypted data and notify via Amazon SNS. Use S3 Events to call an AWS Lambda function and verify if the file is encrypted.
C. Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on the load balancer, ensure that AWS Lambda is using SSL to communicate to the RDS database, and enable S3 encryption. Configure the application to force SSL for incoming connections and configure RDS to only grant access if the session is encrypted. Configure Amazon Inspector agents on EC2 instances to report on insecure encryption ciphers.
D. Enable SSE encryption on the S3 buckets, EBS volumes, and the RDS database. Store RDS credentials in EC2 Parameter Store. Enable a policy on the S3 bucket to deny unencrypted puts. Set up AWS Config rules to periodically check for non-encrypted S3 objects and EBS volumes, and to ensure that RDS storage is encrypted.

### Q90
Two teams are working together on different portions of an architecture and are using AWS CloudFormation to manage their resources. One team administers operating system-level updates and patches, while the other team manages application-level dependencies and updates. The Application team must take the most recent AMI when creating new instances and deploying the application.
What is the MOST scalable method for linking these two teams and processes?
A. The Operating System team uses CloudFormation to create new versions of their AMIs and lists the Amazon Resource names (ARNs) of the AMIs in an encrypted Amazon S3 object as part of the stack output section. The Application team uses a cross-stack reference to load the encrypted S3 object and obtain the most recent AMI ARNs.
B. The Operating System team uses CloudFormation stack to create an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that builds new AMIs, then places the latest AMI ARNs in an encrypted Amazon S3 object as part of the pipeline output. The Application team uses a cross-stack reference within their own CloudFormation template to get that S3 object location and obtain the most recent AMI ARNs to use when deploying their application.
C. The Operating System team uses CloudFormation stack to create an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that builds new AMIs. The team then places the AMI ARNs as parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as part of the pipeline output. The Application team specifies a parameter of type ssm in their CloudFormation stack to obtain the most recent AMI ARN from the Parameter Store.
D. The Operating System team maintains a nested stack that includes both the operating system and Application team templates. The Operating System team uses a stack update to deploy updates to the application stack whenever the Application team changes the application code.

### Q94
A company runs a three-tier web application in its production environment, which is built on a single AWS CloudFormation template made up of Amazon EC2 instances behind an ELB Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Data is stored in an
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance with read replicas. Amazon Route 53 manages the applicationâ€™s public DNS record.
A DevOps Engineer must create a workflow to mitigate a failed software deployment by rolling back changes in the production environment when a software cutover occurs for new application software.
What steps should the Engineer perform to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of downtime?
A. Use CloudFormation to deploy an additional staging environment and configure the Route 53 DNS with weighted records. During cutover, change the Route 53 A record weights to achieve an even traffic distribution between the two environments. Validate the traffic in the new environment and immediately terminate the old environment if tests are successful.
B. Use a single AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to deploy the staging and production environments. Update the environment by uploading the ZIP file with the new application code. Swap the Elastic Beanstalk environment CNAME. Validate the traffic in the new environment and immediately terminate the old environment if tests are successful.
C. Use a single AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment and an AWS OpsWorks environment to deploy the staging and production environments. Update the environment by uploading the ZIP file with the new application code into the Elastic Beanstalk environment deployed with the OpsWorks stack. Validate the traffic in the new environment and immediately terminate the old environment if tests are successful.
D. Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy an additional staging environment, and configure the Route 53 DNS with weighted records. During cutover, increase the weight distribution to have more traffic directed to the new staging environment as workloads are successfully validated. Keep the old production environment in place until the new staging environment handles all traffic.

* Zero downtime. While the deployment is ongoing, the current Amazon EC2 instances in service should remain in service. No deployment or any other action should be performed on the EC2 instances because they serve production traffic.
* A new fleet of instances should be provisioned for deploying the new application version.
* Once the new application version is deployed successfully in the new fleet of instances, the new instances should be placed in service and the old ones should be removed.
* The rollback should be as easy as possible. If the new fleet of instances fail to deploy the new application version, they should be terminated and the current instances should continue serving traffic as normal.
* The resources within the environment (EC2 Auto Scaling group, Elastic Load Balancing, Elastic Beanstalk DNS CNAME) should remain the same and no DNS change should be made.

Which deployment strategy will meet the requirements?
A. Use rolling deployments with a fixed amount of one instance at a time and set the healthy threshold to OK.
B. Use rolling deployments with additional batch with a fixed amount of one instance at a time and set the healthy threshold to OK.
C. launch a new environment and deploy the new application version there, then perform a CNAME swap between environments.
D. Use immutable environment updates to meet all the necessary requirements.

### Q120
A company that uses electronic health records is running a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances with an Amazon Linux operating system. As part of patient privacy requirements, the company must ensure continuous compliance for patches for operating system and applications running on the EC2 instances.
How can the deployments of the operating system and application patches be automated using a default and custom repository?
A. Use AWS Systems Manager to create a new patch baseline including the custom repository. Execute the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document using the run command to verify and install patches.
B. Use AWS Direct Connect to integrate the corporate repository and deploy the patches using Amazon CloudWatch scheduled events, then use the CloudWatch dashboard to create reports.
C. Use yum-config-manager to add the custom repository under /etc/yum.repos.d and run yum-config-manager-enable to activate the repository.
D. Use AWS Systems Manager to create a new patch baseline including the corporate repository. Execute the AWS-AmazonLinuxDefaultPatchBaseline document using the run command to verify and install patches.

### Q121
A company using AWS CodeCommit for source control wants to automate its continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline on AWS in its development environment. The company has three requirements:
1. There must be a legal and a security review of any code change to make sure sensitive information is not leaked through the source code.
2. Every change must go through unit testing.
3. Every change must go through a suite of functional testing to ensure functionality.
In addition, the company has the following requirements for automation:
1. Code changes should automatically trigger the CI/CD pipellline.
2. Any failure in the pipeline should notify devops-admin@xyz.com.
3. There must be an approval to stage the assets to Amazon S3 after tests have been performed.
What should a DevOps Engineer do to meet all of these requirements while following CI/CD best practices?
A. Commit to the development branch and trigger AWS CodePipeline from the development branch. Make an individual stage in CodePipeline for security review, unit tests, functional tests, and manual approval. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to detect changes in pipeline stages and Amazon SES for emailing devops- admin@xyz.com.
B. Commit to mainline and trigger AWS CodePipeline from mainline. Make an individual stage in CodePipeline for security review, unit tests, functional tests, and manual approval. Use AWS CloudTrail logs to detect changes in pipeline stages and Amazon SNS for emailing devops-admin@xyz.com.
C. Commit to the development branch and trigger AWS CodePipeline from the development branch. Make an individual stage in CodePipeline for security review, unit tests, functional tests, and manual approval. Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect changes in pipeline stages and Amazon SNS for emailing devops- admin@xyz.com.

### Q122
A DevOps Engineer uses Docker container technology to build an image-analysis application. The application often sees spikes in traffic. The Engineer must automatically scale the application in response to customer demand while maintaining cost effectiveness and minimizing any impact on availability.
What will allow the FASTEST response to spikes in traffic while fulfilling the other requirements?
A. Create an Amazon ECS cluster with the container instances in an Auto Scaling group. Configure the ECS service to use Service Auto Scaling. Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms to scale the ECS service and cluster.
B. Deploy containers on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Multicontainer Docker environment. Configure Elastic Beanstalk to automatically scale the environment based on Amazon CloudWatch metrics.
C. Create an Amazon ECS cluster using Spot instances. Configure the ECS service to use Service Auto Scaling. Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms to scale the ECS service and cluster.
D. Deploy containers on Amazon EC2 instances. Deploy a container scheduler to schedule containers onto EC2 instances. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling for EC2 instances based on available Amazon CloudWatch metrics.

### Q123
A DevOps Engineer is building a multi-stage pipeline with AWS CodePipeline to build, verify, stage, test, and deploy an application. There is a manual approval stage required between the test and deploy stages. The development team uses a team chat tool with webhook support.
How can the Engineer configure status updates for pipeline activity and approval requests to post to the chat tool?
A. Create an AWS CloudWatch Logs subscription that filters on "detail-type": "CodePipeline Pipeline Execution State Change." Forward that to an Amazon SNS topic. Add the chat webhook URL to the SNS topic as a subscriber and complete the subscription validation.
B. Create an AWS Lambda function that is triggered by the updating of AWS CloudTrail events. When a "CodePipeline Pipeline Execution State Change" event is detected in the updated events, send the event details to the chat webhook URL.
C. Create an AWS CloudWatch Events rule that filters on "CodePipeline Pipeline Execution State Change." Forward that to an Amazon SNS topic. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the Amazon SNS topic and have it forward the event to the chat webhook URL.
D. Modify the pipeline code to send event details to the chat webhook URL at the end of each stage. Parametrize the URL so each pipeline can send to a different URL based on the pipeline environment.
